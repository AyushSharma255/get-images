# get-images

Util script made for automatically fetching images from Lorem Picsum.

### How it works.
All you have to do is:
> python3 get_images.py [url_args] [number_of_images]

Of course you have to replace the values in the square brackets with the actual desired value.

For example, if I wanted 100 200x200 images, I do:
> python3 get_images.py 200 100
